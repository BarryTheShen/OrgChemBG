## Introduction

This board game is designed for organic chemistry enthusiasts. It is a high-level game that requires a solid understanding of fundamental organic synthesis. The game challenges players to use their knowledge to reach specific chemical products through strategic use of reagents and reaction mechanisms.

## How to Play

To start playing, download the release version of the game from the [Releases tab](https://github.com/BarryTheShen/OrgChemBG/releases). The release includes a PDF file that you can print on both sides and cut out to create the cards.

## Rules of the Board Game

### Winning Condition

- Each player is given a set of three "Winning Condition Cards" at the start of the game. The first player to reach their specified product wins. Other players can continue to play until they also reach their products, if desired.

### Card Types

1. **Winning Condition Cards**
   
   - Each player receives three cards at the beginning of the game, which define the products they must synthesize to win. These cards must be kept secret from other players.

2. **Normal Cards**
   
   - These cards represent common reagents and are drawn from a communal pile. Each player draws four cards at the start of their turn. 

3. **Premium Cards**
   
   - These are powerful reagents that can be purchased using PDT tokens. They are more versatile and valuable for completing difficult reactions. Each premium card has a specific cost in PDTs, with some cards (like wildcards) being more expensive.

4. **PDT Cards**
   
   - These represent public goals. Completing these goals earns players PDT tokens, which can be used to purchase premium cards.

### Setup

- **Card Areas:**
  1. **Hand-Held Area:** Players can hold up to 10 cards here, which they use during their turn.
  2. **Reactor Area:** This is where the reaction takes place. The current reactant molecule is kept here.
  3. **Trading Area:**
     - **Normal Section:** Initially holds 10 reagents. Players can trade two of their hand-held cards for one reagent from this section. It expands as the game progresses.
     - **Premium Section:** Holds premium cards that can be purchased with PDTs.
  4. **PDT Area:** Where PDT tokens are managed. Players earn PDTs by successfully synthesizing specific products.
  5. **Trash Pile:** Discarded cards go here and are reshuffled into the draw pile when necessary.

### Gameplay

1. **Draw/Change Round:** Players choose to either draw four cards or trade cards from the normal section.
2. **Buy:** Players may purchase premium cards using PDT tokens.
3. **Do:** Players can perform one step of their reaction.
4. **Count:** The reaction proceeds, and the product is formed. If the product matches a PDT card, the player earns a PDT token.
5. **Throwaway:** Players must discard cards if they hold more than 10.

### Special/Miscellaneous Rules

- **Card Pile Running Out:** If the draw pile runs out, reshuffle the discarded cards back into the pile. All players must discard all but two of their cards, except for PDT and premium cards.
- **Stereochemistry and Specific Conditions:** Stereochemistry and specific reaction conditions (like high pressure or low temperature) are not considered. Ambiguous regioselectivity is resolved by the player conducting the reaction.
